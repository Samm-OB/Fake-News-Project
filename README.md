ðŸ“° Fake News Detection Model
This project is a machine learning-based classifier that detects whether a given news article is fake or real. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process text data and applies classification algorithms to make predictions. The primary goal is to help combat misinformation by building an automated system that evaluates the credibility of textual news content.


ðŸš€ Features
Preprocessing of news data using tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization

Text classification using Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / Random Forest

Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

User input option for real-time prediction of news authenticity

Streamlit interface (if applicable)

ðŸ§° Requirements
Install the following Python packages:

pip install  requirements
